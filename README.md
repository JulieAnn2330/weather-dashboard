Weather Dashboard

Deployed program: https://julieann2330.github.io/weather-dashboard/

Technologies Used: HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, OpenWeather API Call, Ajax

This is a homework assignment that I created for the University of Kansas Coding BootCamp.

This week's assignment was to create a weather dashboard utiliting the OpenWeather API. Users can search by city and the city is stored in a search list for future reference. Upon searching the dashboard will display the current forecast, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index and an icon representing the current weather. A five-day forecast is also included.

I utilized several coding websites for help, including StackOverflow and w3schools.com I also watched YouTube tutorials and got assistance from fellow student Aurora Brune.

The full details of the project are listed below.

# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Use the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities. The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that will provide basic setup and usage instructions. Use `localStorage` to store any persistent data.

## User Story

```
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
WHEN I open the weather dashboard
THEN I am presented with the last searched city forecast
```
